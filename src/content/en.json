    "logline": "Spunky, silly, and scientifically enhanced, our main guy Frog had just enough smarts to make it into college. But does he have the guts to make it through?",
    "summary": "Frog was once just a regular fly (eating) guy, until a scientist picked him for some intelligence-enhancing experiments. Now he’s so smart that he’s going to college! His acceptance made headlines, but by move-in day, the people have moved on. Now he’s on his own at a new school, making new friends with a new species. He’s got great friends, wise mentors, a super smart Frog Mom, and a soda corporation mysteriously funding his education. Sure, he’s a Frog. But he’s also just a normal college guy: watching out for hangovers, failed midterms, and predatory birds."
